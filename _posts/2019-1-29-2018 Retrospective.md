I know it is a little late but I wanted to get this out anyway. 2018 was insane. Lots of things happened and I am aiming to make more things happen for 2019. Let’s stop talking about, let’s get into it.

# What did I accomplish?

### Spartan

Last April, I met my best friend, Spartan. He is a German Shepherd with a ton of energy. The fur missle is so active and such a happy puppy; I couldn’t be happier. And he has taught me so much, too. Love, patience (oh my lord, so much patience), and how to properly train a dog. By far, the best thing that happened.

### Got below 200 lbs. 

I achieved this goal rather quickly, though unintentionally. I got a bad stomach flu and didn’t want to eat for about a month. After getting better, I watched my portion sizes and tried to eat healthy. It was that easy. The last time I weighed this much was Sophomore year of high school.

### Purchased a camera and started photographing

Learning photography, the process of taking pictures, and editing them has been so much fun. Admittedly most of my pictures have been of my pup Spartan, I mean, who can blame me.

### Began Cooking more

This has been super exciting! I have learned to make a bunch of new recipes and, arguably more important, how to properly spice my food. I hope to continue making new recipes and adding to my collection.

### Visited Seattle

I have never been to Seattle and this trip was amazing. I got to see Microsoft and some Halo exhibits, the Amazon Go Store, and the original Starbucks roastery. I can’t wait to move to the city one day.

### Learned to be more productive

In the past, I would keep everything in my head. Ideas, random thoughts about stuff, plans, and events would never be written down. Remarkably, nothing too insane has happened from the lack of organization. 

To combat this bad habit, I began using apps like ToDoist, Google Calendar and OneNote, drastically improving my productivity. If I have a random idea or task that I need to complete, I will add it to ToDoist, which allows me to organize it later. OneNote maintains notes that I create while reading a book or trying to design something. And, obviously, Google Calendar will maintain the events and due dates of the various things. My mind is less cluttered, and things are forgotten less. Win-win.

# What could I have done better?

Not only should I look back at what went well, I should look at what didn’t go well, and make steps to improve them.

### Better Spending

Throughout the year, I made unnecessary, frivolous purchases like a Macbook Pro and a guitar that I never play. Literally thousands of dollars that I am not using and that could have been put to more important things. In response, I created a savings goal along with a budget that I need to maintain. I think I know how to budget, I just chose not to. That changes this year.

### Blogging more often

Honestly, I was just lazy. Blogging was just another thing that I needed to add to growing to-do list, and after getting Spartan, spare time was scarce. I just wanted to relax. Now that I have a handle on Spartan and my life, I am going to get back to this.

### Set concrete goals

The goals I set for myself last year were way too broad. Most goals had vague descriptions like “Get Better” blah blah blah. What is the definition of “better”? How do I know when I am “better”? How much “better” should I get? 

What I should have done was set more concrete goals. For example, I should have said, “I will print one picture I have taken every month”. That way I am working towards my goal with steps or deadlines along the way.

### Think more realistically about goals

Arguably, the most important thing I should have done better. Ambition swept over me like a toddler in California surf. I over stretched myself and didn’t complete nearly as much as I wanted. Not that I am complaining, but Spartan has taken a lot of time. More time than I anticipated. This left little time to do anything and I was exhausted at days’ end.

So, I began prioritizing things and I still am. My time management improved, and I feel like I am moving in life. If something comes up where I have to choose one or the other, I go by the one that is higher priority for myself.

## Conclusion

2018 was a great year. I met my best friend, explored some new areas, and learned along the way. While I am not going to mention my goals for 2019, I hope to share them as I meet them.
