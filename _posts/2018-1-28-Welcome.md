Welcome to my new blog/website! As you can see most things look pretty plain and boring. Hopefully, with time,this will become an awesome blog/portfolio website where I talk about the stuff I am working on. I am kind of new to Jekyll so this will be a learning experience as well. 

In short, I am a Software Engineer at [Alarm.com](https://www.alarm.com). I am not super nerdy all the time though. I play indoor/outdoor soccer, softball, do weight lifting, and cook sometimes. I also enjoy learning new things, like photography or playing the guitar.

My goal this year is to have one blog post each month, sometimes two if I am feeling lucky. These topics will range widely, from technology and programming posts to photography and my new puppy (when I get him). 

If you're still reading, good for you! I'll probably have something more interesting later.
