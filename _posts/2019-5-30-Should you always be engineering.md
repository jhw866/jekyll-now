A few days ago, I was talking with a co-worker over lunch and I mentioned that I was working on a side project. I didn’t explain what it was initially, but he gave a slight scoff and said he doesn’t work on side projects outside of work.

“Really, why not?”, I asked.

“Because I want to keep my work and life separated”, he said.

If you read a lot of posts on Medium or other development focused blog sites, you probably have seen your fair share of articles that say you should be working on side projects. Stuff like 

* When you get home from work or on the weekends, you should be continuing to hone your craft to keep up with tech.  
* You must be passionate
* Always be learning

But are these articles accurate? I mean, my coworker is incredibly smart. And I am not being biased; he is an objectively intelligent person. Shouldn’t he be working on side projects to keep up?

Like many questions in life, I think the answer lies in the gray area.

### People need breaks

Constantly engineering can wear a person out. It is a mentally taxing and frustrating career. And to effectively work for years, people need to have breaks. People need to have hobbies. 

In college, I didn’t have many hobbies other than watching TV. I was always working on schoolwork or some side project. I very rarely did anything for myself, resulting in burnout. And when I graduated and had more free time, I didn’t really know what to do with myself. All I could think of is finding some side project to work on. 

Now, I am learning photography, playing with my dog, cooking, playing video games, and working on a blog.

### But we have to keep up with tech

But I still work on side projects because there is some truth to what those articles are saying. If you’re not working and learning, I believe it will be easy to get left behind. 

Tech changes at a rapid pace. For example, in the last 2 years Android’s landscape has changed substantially. If I hadn’t put in some time to learn by watching Google I/O videos, I would be way behind.

Working on side projects helps learning new tools, new technologies, and new ways of doing things. It can open you mind to ideas you never had thought of before and can help you land a career at your dream company.

And it really helps when your side project is something you are passionate or interested in that you may not be able to explore at work. For me, that is game development. I am working on a Minecraft clone in unity to learn the technology and have some fun along the way. And for me it doesn’t feel like work, which is the goal.

### So what should I do?

I believe life is about balance. You have your work, you have your hobbies, and your life. To keep up, spending a little time after work to keep tabs on what is going on in the world of tech will help push you to where you want to go. 

But make sure to take some time off for yourself. You work hard and deserve some R&R. Go get that video game and have some fun.
