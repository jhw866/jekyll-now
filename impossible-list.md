As I mentioned in this [blog post]({{site.baseurl}}/2018-Goals), I began feeling rather lethargic after I graduated college. Most of my days were wake up, go to work, maybe workout, go home, watch TV/YouTube, go to bed. Sometimes I would hang out with friends, but I would rather stay on the couch.

So, I got bored. Fast. But I kept doing it. I became one with the couch. It is really comfortable though.

Then in December of 2017, I decided to do something about it. 
Initially, the list was the cliché New Year’s Resolution for 2018. I wanted goals set out for myself this year to provide me drive and motivation. 

Not too long after I discovered Thomas Frank's [CollegeInfoGeek](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/) and saw he had this really cool thing called an [Impossible List](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/). Thanks, Thomas!

In short, you can think of the Impossible List as Bucket List that grows and contracts with age, compared to a Bucket List which only shrinks. The [creator of the Impossible List](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/) hope people will use this as a tool to keep striving to reach their goals and consistently working on themselves rather than looking at their goals as a dream.

So, to keep myself accountable, I am showing this list off to the world. I hope to consistently cross off items as I complete them as well as add ideas when they come to mind.
