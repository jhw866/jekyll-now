Sup, my name is Jeremy and I am a Software Engineer by day, Dog-Dad full time. 

### What do you do?
Currently, I am a Software Engineer at [Alarm.com](https://www.alarm.com) where I integrate new security panels with our backend (like the IQ Gen2), design message protocols between the panel and the backend, and enhance and optimize panel/backend communication for our 5,000,000 customers. Additionally, I write automated tests that test panel firmware, verifying the panel can safely integrate with our architecture. Lastly, I mentor interns and new hires for our team, ensuring they have the tools and knowledge they have to succeed.

### That's cool. Now, what do really do?
I am obsessed with Halo, playing out with my pup, and pretty much anything nerdy or techy. I also fancy myself a little DnD occassionally. Outside of my apartment, I try to work out A LOT! I weight-lift, play in softball and soccer, and try to run on a regular basis. Hiking is favorite of mine too.

### That puppy is so cute! What is his name?

Right?!?! His name is Spartan, a pure-bred German Shepherd, and he is a hard-headed and extremely driven pup. This guy is awesome!

### How do I reach you?

If you want to say wut up, [email me here](mailto:{{site.footer-links.email}}). You can check out my resume [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/resume.pdf). Otherwise, I'll catch you later. Have a good one!
